  <li>Ray Eames, Splint</li>
<br>

  <ul style="list-style-type:none">
  <li>During World War II, the U.S. Navy commissioned designers Charles and Ray Eames to use their molded plywood technique to develop leg splints for wounded soldiers. These urgently needed designs, with their requisite attention to human form, inspired the Eames plywood chair, which became an icon of postwar American design.</li>

  <li>Richard Anuszkiewicz, Primary Hue</li>
<br>
 <ul style="list-style-type:none">
  <li>Richard Anuszkiewicz was one of the originators of the Op Art movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Like his mentor, Josef Albers, Anuszkiewicz was a color theorist who created series of paintings exploring color properties within specific geometric forms. Primary Hue generates the optical illusion of nested squares of red, but in fact only a single red-painted ground underlies the radiating lines. The lines alternate color as they radiate, causing the red ground to appear to change color. As with much Op Art, this painting creates an impression by tricking the viewer’s eye rather than actually representing what the eye sees.</li>
